This is how we can build models in Amazon SageMaker and port them into Cloud Pak for Data and run them in Watson Studio.

**Optional**

Repeat the above steps for uploading the remaining notebooks in this repository.

**Note**:- The home directory has to be changed in the SageMaker Notebooks after uploading them into Watson Studio. **Save the model to home directory** cell will need home directory replaced to **"/home/wsuser/work"** in cell numbers 37 to 41 for **WS-Flanders-Predict.ipynb** notebook and cell numbers 36 to 40 for **WS-Belgium-Predict.ipynb** notebook.
