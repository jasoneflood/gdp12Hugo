In this workshop, we have learnt how to extract data from different sources, pre-process the data, generate two use cases, and build multiple models in SageMaker notebooks using SageMaker in-built algorithms & open sourced modules. 

* We have also learnt how to port SageMaker notebooks into Watson Studio to generate SageMaker endpoints. 
* We have configured Watson Open Scale to set up & monitor SageMaker endpoints in Cloud Pak for Data for Fairness, Quality & Drift metrics. 
* This methodology helps to integrate different services using IBM & AWS for building end-to-end solutions.
