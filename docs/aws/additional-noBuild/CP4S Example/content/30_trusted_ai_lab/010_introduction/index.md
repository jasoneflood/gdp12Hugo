Welcome to the Trusted AI Lab!

In this immersion day lab, we will demonstrate how to generate use-cases, build predictive models in SageMaker and port the notebooks & models into IBM Cloud Pak for Data. We will run the SageMaker notebooks in Watson Studio canvas and generate predictions.

The intent of this workshop is to educate users about the features of AWS SageMaker & IBM Cloud Pak for Data running on AWS.

**Background in Data and AI, Data Science are required for this lab.**

After completing this lab, you will understand how to :

* Pre-process & analysis of data
* Merge data to create consolidated files
* Generate use-cases from the consolidated files for building predictive models
* Build multiple predictive models using SageMaker and generate predictions
* Download the models from SageMaker and Import them into Watson Studio
* Run the notebooks in Watson Studio and generate predictions
* Write the predicted results to S3 bucket
* Monitor SageMaker models in Watson Open Scale
* Visualize the processed data with forecasted results in embedded dashboard.
