## Learning Objectives:
> #### In this tutorial you will learn:
> 1. How to make a connection between external data sources & IBM CP4D connectors.
> 2. How to query multiple data sources wihout creating data replicas using IBM Data Virtualization service.

## Learning Outcome:
At the end of the workshop you will learn how to connects multiple data sources across locations by creating one virtual data view. 

For this workshop, you have Covid-19 regional data stored in **Amazon S3** and **Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL** data sources. In this workshop you will use **IBM Data Virtualization  Service** to create virtual data view.

The proposed solution will solves data silos challenges faced by enterprises which force them to copy the data into centralized repository for analytics.

## Prerequisites:
> 1. IBM Cloud Pak for Data
> 2. Data Virtualization on IBM Cloud Pak for Data
> 3. External Data Sources (Amazon S3, Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL)
> 4. IBM Watson Knowledge Catalog

## Estimated time:
It should take you approximately 10-15 minutes to complete this lab.

## Lab Steps:

>#### Step 1: Login to IBM Cloud Pak for Data with valid credentials

To perform this lab you need IBM Cloud Pak for Data's user credentials (eg. userxxxx) which you have created earlier. Credentials include both username and password. If you do not have the credentials then refer **Infra Provisioning Lab** exercise to get the credentials.

>#### Step 3: Create virtual tables

_Congratulations!_

In the previous step you have successfully created connection between external data sources and **Data Virtualization** service. Now you can select tables and file from the connection and create virtualized tables or objects. Once tables are virtualized you can create a VIEW by joining two virtual tables.

1. Open the Data Virtualization menu and click on **Virtualization** to expand and then click **Virtualize** as shown below.

![Virtualize Menu](/static/images/30_governance_lab/virtualize_menu.png)

2. Click on connection (eg **Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL**) and then you might see several tables under public schema.

> If there are multiple connections listed, choose only one which you have created in previous step.

![Create Virtual Table](/static/images/30_governance_lab/create_virtual_table_1.png)

Select the tables (**ts_wallonia_region_table** and **ts_flanders_region_table**) one by one and then click Add to cart. Once after adding both the tables to the cart, click View cart.

![Create Virtual Table](/static/images/30_governance_lab/create_virtual_table_2.png)

3. As shown in this screen, Select the **Virtualize Data** option and provide a **unique name** to table (in the image below names are ts_wallonia_region_table and ts_flanders_region_table). 

> You might need tables name in the next step. so, note it down for future reference.

![Create Virtual Table Options](/static/images/30_governance_lab/virtualize_1.1.png)

Now click on three dots and then click **Edit columns** option (eg **ts_flanders_region_table**) to verify name, type and length of the columns matches with image below and click **Apply**.

>#### Step 4: Create VIEW by joining two virtual tables/objects
Till now we have created connections with external data sources and from external data sources we picked tables and files to Virtualize them. Now we will use those Virtualize tables/objects and join them to create a VIEW. This VIEW will give us capability to query multiple data sources without creating data replicas.

You can follow below steps to create VIEW:

1. Click **Data Virtualization** menu and expand **Virtualization** and then click **Virtualized Data** option.

![Virtualized Data Menu](/static/images/30_governance_lab/view_menu.png)

2. Select the virtual tables which you have created in the previous step. (eg here **ts_wallonia_region_table** and **ts_flanders_region_table**) and click Join.

> You may see multiple tables, choose only those two that you have created.

![Select Tables](/static/images/30_governance_lab/Join_View_1.1.png)

3. Join two tables by specify join key and then click **Preview** to preview joined table.
