In this Governance Lab, we will demonstrate the following 4 **use-cases** with the help of Covid-19 datasets:

1. In the `Data Virtualization` lab we will create a single virtualized VIEW by joining different Covid regional data coming from multiple data sources such as Amazon S3 and Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL. This VIEW will give you the capability of query multiple data sources without copying or moving them.

2. In the Data Integration lab attendees will learn how to create data integration pipeline to integrate healthcare personnel data using `IBM DataStage`.

3. In the Data Cleansing and Reshaping lab, attendees will use `IBM Data Refinery` flow to clean healthcare personnel data and filter out personnel above 65 age from being deployed in Covid impacted regions.

4. In the Data Governance Lab, attendees will learn how to mask sensitive informations present in healthcare personnel (pii) data using `IBM Watson Knowledge Catalog` (WKC).
