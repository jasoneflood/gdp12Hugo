<!-- Getting Started -->

To start this workshop, make sure you have an AWS account to use services used in the lab exercises. Follow one of the following options:

* [Start the workshop in your own AWS Account.](/10_getting_started/01_self_paced/), or
* [Start the workshop on an AWS hosted event, using AWS provided hashes for the AWS EventEngine.](/10_getting_started/02_aws_event/)

Once you have completed with either setup, continue with [**Infrastructure Provisioning Lab**](/20_infrastructure_provisioning_lab/)
