<!--- # Service Instances Provisioning --->

## Learning Objectives
In this Lab we will configure and launch service instances required in IBM Cloud pak for Data. This lab required below services to be configured additionally:
- Data Virtualization
- Cognos Analytics

## Prerequisites
- IBM Cloud Pak for Data
- Data Virtualization
- Cognos Analytics

## Lab Steps:

1. Login to IBM Cloud Pak for Data with valid credentials

To perform this lab you need IBM Cloud Pak for Data's credential which include both username and password. If you do not have the credentials then refer previous lab exercise to get the credentials.

2. Check if IBM Data Virtualization service is installed and provisioned

Follow the below steps to make sure IBM Data Virtualization service service is installed and provisioned in the provided IBM Cloud Pak for Data instance.

**Steps:**

1. Go to hamburger navigation menu and click on services and then click on services catalog to see all available services for this instance

**If in step 3 & 4 you could see Data Virtualization service is up and running then you DON'T have to follow below steps and you can skip to STEP-11.**

5. Follow only step 3 and 4 are failed. Go to hamburger navigation menu and click **Services** then **Instances**
