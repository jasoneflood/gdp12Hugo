IBM Cloud Pak for Data is deployed on a multi-node Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster. 

::alert[**On the AWS Cloud, you have the option of deploying Cloud Pak for Data on a self-managed OpenShift cluster, or Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA).**]

Please use the following link to get access to a 60-day trial of Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster, as you will need it to complete this workshop:

If you are planning to deploy Cloud Pak for Data on ROSA, you will need to enable the service in your AWS account by navigating to the [ROSA service](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rosa/home) and selecting **Enable OpenShift**.
