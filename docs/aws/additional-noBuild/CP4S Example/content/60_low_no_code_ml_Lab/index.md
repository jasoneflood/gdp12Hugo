In this Immersion Day lab, you will have the choice to leverage Jupyter Notebooks and AutoAI. With Jupyter Notebooks, you will learn how to create and configure an open source environment and then build machine learning models using Python code. Finally, you will learn how to use AutoAI to rapidly prototype machine learning models, accelerating time-to-value.

This lab will highlight the choice of tools available in the IBM Cloud Pak for Data platform, allowing team members with different backgrounds and skillsets to work together on data science projects.

When you have completed this Lab, you will understand how to:

- Build classification and time-series models in IBM Cloud Pak for Data Watson Studio Jupyter notebooks.
- Visualize data in IBM Cloud Pak for Data Cognos Dashboard Embedded.
- Build and compare different classification models in IBM Cloud Pak for Data AutoAI Experiments.
- Invoke Watson Machine Learning model deployed on IBM Cloud pak for Data in you applications running on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).
