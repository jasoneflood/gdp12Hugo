::alert[In this lab exercise, you will learn a popular machine learning algorithm, Decision Tree. You will use this classification algorithm to build a model from historical data of region and their total cases. Then you use the trained decision tree to predict the Risk Index of a region.]

## Notebook 3 : Risk Index Prediction with Decision Tree

1. In Cloud Pak for Data, click on the **Assets** tab on top, under **Asset types** expand the **Source code** tab and select **Notebook**.

1. You will see the three notebooks listed. You will refer to the **Region-All-Decision-Tree.ipynb** notebook.

1. Click on the **three dot** menu and select **edit** to get started.

1. Before running the notebook, you need to add the S3 connection to the notebook.
  - Click on the third code cell in the notebook.
  - Click on **find and add data** button on top right.
  - Click on **Connections** tab.
  - You will see your connection variable. Click on **Insert to code** and select **pandas DataFrame**.
  - Select the **RI-data-ML.csv** dataset from the connection variable.

6. Verify the dataframe name to be `data_df_1` in the generated code snippet.

7. Click on **Cell** and select **Run All** to run the notebook.

8. This will run the notebook, it will take some time please be patient.

9. Once the notebook is completed you can observe the following in the notebook:
  - **Decision Tree Model Accuracy**
  - **Decision Tree Visualization**

10. **Decision Tree Model Accuracy:** You can observe the accuracy of the model is 86.63%.
