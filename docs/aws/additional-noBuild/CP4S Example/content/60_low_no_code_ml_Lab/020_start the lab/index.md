## Learning Outcome

1. Build classification and time-series models in IBM Cloud Pak for Data Watson Studio Jupyter notebooks.
2. Visualize data in IBM Cloud Pak for Data Cognos Dashboard Embedded.
3. Build and compare different classification models in IBM Cloud Pak for Data AutoAI Experiments.
4. Invoke Watson Machine Learning model deployed on IBM Cloud pak for Data in you applications running on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).

## Estimated time

Completing this lab should take about 1 hour.

## Lab Steps
::expand[In this step, you will learn to create a project and setup a connection to Amazon S3 bucket in your IBM Cloud Pak for Data.]{header="1. Setup a project in Cloud Pak for Data"}

::expand[In this step, you will learn how to build two types of prediction models in Watson Studio's Jupyter Notebooks. As a developer, you have full control over the model's hyperparameters and the training data in this section.]{header="2. Code Approach"}

::expand[In this step, you learn how to build responsive data visualization in Watson Studio's Cognos Embedded Dashboard. You will use the data generated in the previous section to build the following visualizations: 1. Current trends and future predictions of COVID-19 cases by region and 2. Model evaluation metrics, such as actual vs. predicted cases and model loss by region]{header="3. Visualization"}

::expand[In this step, you will learn how to build a prediction model in Watson Studio AutoAI. As a developer, you will experience no-code method using Watson Studio's AutoAI that automatically prepares data, applies machine learning algorithms and builds model pipelines that are best suited for your data sets and predictive modeling. Aditionally, you will also learn how to invoke the Watson Machine Learning model deployed on Cloud pak for Data in you applications running on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).]{header="4. No Code Approach"}
