COVID cases have started to appear in many of the GRTâ€™s regions. Luckily, the team has a good understanding of which regions are susceptibleand the teams available to respond. To minimize outbreak impact, it is essential that the GRT help local agencies maintain a proactive approach to outbreak response and distribute resources based on the number of expected COVID cases. To enable this, you will need to create a model to predict future COVID casesin each region based on regional risk and current COVID levels.you will then use this model to help decide how to commit resources to respond to the pandemic.

#### Approach

How to work across organization silos to rapidly build, run, and manage machine learning models in a collaborative data science environment?

During the lab you will have the choice to leverage Jupyter Notebooks and AutoAI. With Jupyter Notebooks, you will learn how to create and configure an open source environment and then build machine learning models using Python code. Finally, you will learn how to use AutoAI to rapidly prototype machine learning models, accelerating time-to-value.

This lab will highlight the choice of tools available in the Cloud Pak for Data platform, allowing team members with different backgrounds and skillsets to work together on data science projects.
