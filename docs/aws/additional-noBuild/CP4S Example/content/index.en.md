## Introduction

The **IBM Cloud Pak for Data (CP4D) on AWS Modernization Workshop** will provide hands-on guided learning experience focused on **IBM Cloud Pak for Data** (CP4D) capabilities and AWS integrations. This workshop will help attendees to learn how IBM and AWS products and services together can solve real pain points and challenges faced by Data Analytics industry.

## Business Problem

The workshop will provide an evolving, narrative-centric experience by placing attendees on a Covid-19 pandemic global response team (GRT) working to identify new Covid-19 outbreaks and help local authorities mount an effective response.

## Target Audience

Architects, Developers, Data Scientists, Machine Learning Practitioners

## What you will learn
Each lab in the workshop represents a real pain point **data analytics** industry faces. By going through each lab, attendees will learn how to solve the challenges and pain points with the help of reference architecture and lab exercises.

IBM Cloud Pak for Data (CP4D) on AWS Modernization Workshop is divided into 5 different labs.

* Lab - 1: **Infrastructure Provisioning Lab**. Use AWS Cloud9 environment to create IBM Cloud Pak for Data users and load data into multiple data sources.

* Lab - 2: **Trusted AI Lab**. Learn how to build an end-to-end trusted AI solution using IBM and AWS solutions and services. You will learn how to use IBM Watson® OpenScale™, Watson Studio on AWS together with Amazon SageMaker.

* Lab - 3: **Governance Lab**. Learn how to use different approaches to integrate data coming from different data sources in hybrid cloud environment. Moreover, attendees will also learn how to run ETL pipeline, how to clean, reshape, and govern the data. This lab will help attendees learn about IBM DataStage, Data Virtualization, IBM Watson Knowledge Catalog and how to integrate with Amazon S3, Amazon RedShift, Amazon RDS.

* Lab - 4: **Visualization & Insights Lab**. Learn the Visualization & Insights capabilities of IBM Cognos Analytics on the AWS Cloud. 

* Lab - 5: **Low/No Code ML Lab**. You will learn how to use IBM Watson Studio AutoAI to rapidly prototype machine learning models, accelerating time-to-value.
