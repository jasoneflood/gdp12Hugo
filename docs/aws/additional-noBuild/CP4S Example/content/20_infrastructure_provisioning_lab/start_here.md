  - Load data to Amazon S3, AWS Redshift and AWS RDS Aurora.
  - Create users in IBM Cloud Pak For Data
  - Generate credential to access the AWS services.

## Prerequisites
- IBM Cloud Pak for Data
- AWS Account

## Overview

This lab implements creating required infrastructure and loading data
onto respective AWS resources.

## Lab Environment

### Step 1: AWS Resources used in this lab
#### AWS Cloud9
**AWS Cloud9** is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser. It includes a code editor, debugger, and terminal. Cloud9 comes prepackaged with essential tools for popular programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, PHP, and more, so you donâ€™t need to install files or configure your development machine to start new projects. Since your Cloud9 IDE is cloud-based, you can work on your projects from your office, home, or anywhere using an internet-connected machine.

##### How we made it different?
In this cloud9 environment we have pre-installed with the required tools and utilities to access specific to our lab execution.

### Step 2: Cli Resources used in this lab
#### Openshift Cli
With the OpenShift command-line interface (CLI), the oc command, you can create applications and manage OpenShift Container Platform projects from a terminal. The **OpenShift CLI** is ideal in the following situations:

* Working directly with project source code

* Scripting OpenShift Container Platform operations

* Managing projects while restricted by bandwidth resources and the web console is unavailable

#### AWS CLI
The AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) is a unified tool to manage your AWS services. With just one tool to download and configure, you can control multiple AWS services from the command line and automate them through scripts.

### Step 3: How to access the cloud9 environment?
Your instructor will provide you with the credentials to login. Access Cloud9 Environment through browser console.

1.  Set environment variable. 

```sh
export OCP_USER=<<LAB INSTRUCTOR WILL SHARE VALUE>>
export OCP_PASSWORD=<<LAB INSTRUCTOR WILL SHARE VALUE>>
export OCP_API=<<LAB INSTRUCTOR WILL SHARE VALUE>>
```

2.  Run command to login to the cluster

```sh
oc login --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true -u ${OCP_USER} -p ${OCP_PASSWORD} ${OCP_API}:6443
```

**Expected Output:**

Login successful.

You have access to 66 projects, the list has been suppressed. You can list all projects with 'oc projects'


3.  Create users in CP4D cluster and **note down the user details**.

```sh
./create_users.sh
```

**Expected Output:**

Users created successfully.
Password for both XXXXXXX and XXXXXXX is: XXXXXXX
Providing access to service instances
Giving user access to service instances - In Progress
Giving user access to service instances - Done

4.  Get the route.

```sh
oc get route -n zen |awk 'NR==2 {print $2}'
```

Using the route, users will be able to login into CP4D using the above created credentials and start Lab exercises.

## Conclusions

1.  We have learned how to use the command line tools.

2.  We have learned how to access the openshift cluster and CP4D
    environment.

## Appendix

1. To print credentials, endpoints of Amazon S3, RedShift, Postgres attendees can run the below script.

```sh
./printcredentials.sh
```
